## Let's keep ourselves and the atmosphere healthy.
Explore your neighborhood by biking to a beer (just one) while listening to beats.<br><br>
Share your location, desired transit time, and cycling mood. We'll suggest a playlist that suits your mood and surprise you with a destination to meet a friend.

## Optimizations and considerations
- `useSWR`
- remove `styled-components`, instead use `tailwind` for performance
- more testing finding destinations (sparse areas, dense areas)

## Go be spontaneous with your friend
